# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the unified entry point for all OctoAcme project management documentation. It improves discoverability and onboarding by providing a single place to find all process documentation, reducing knowledge silos and helping new team members quickly understand our project management approach.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible approach to project management that ensures successful delivery of product features, services, and integrations.

**Key Principles:**
- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback and learning

**Project Lifecycle:**
1. **Initiation:** Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning:** Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution:** Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release:** Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective:** Capture learnings and next steps

**Core Roles:**
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals

**Key Artifacts:**
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
