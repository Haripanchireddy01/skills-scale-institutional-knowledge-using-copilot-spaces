# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the entry point for all project management documentation used by OctoAcme. It centralizes our processes, artifacts, and links to improve discoverability and onboarding for new and existing teammates.

Overview — OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme delivers projects using customer-first, iterative, and data-driven principles. Our framework emphasizes clear ownership, stakeholder alignment, risk management, and continuous improvement. Key principles:
- Customer-first: prioritize delivering measurable value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: small, testable increments with fast feedback loops.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure outcomes and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage candid feedback and blameless learning.

Lifecycle (high-level)

1. Initiation — define the problem, stakeholders, and success metrics (Project One-pager).
2. Planning — break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks.
3. Execution — build, test, review, and iterate with a regular team rhythm.
4. Release — deploy, verify, and communicate changes safely.
5. Close & Retrospective — capture learnings and create action items for continuous improvement.

Core Roles and Key Artifacts

- Roles: Project Manager (PM), Product Manager (PdM), Developers, QA/Testing, Stakeholders.
- Artifacts: Project One-pager / Charter, Roadmap & Release Plan, Sprint/Iteration Backlog, Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done, Risk Register, Retrospective notes and action items.

How to use these docs

- Keep the Project Charter / One-pager updated in the project repo as the single source of truth for project status and success criteria.
- Add process-specific docs into .copilot/ for Copilot Spaces to include them as contextual knowledge where appropriate.
- Follow the checklists provided in each document for initiation, planning, execution, and release activities.
- To propose updates to any process doc, use the issue template at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml.
